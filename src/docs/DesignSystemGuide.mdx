# Edvara Design System

This design system is built with Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui to provide a consistent and accessible user interface.

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity**: Components should be easy to use and understand
- **Flexibility**: Customizable for different contexts and needs
- **Accessibility**: Follows WCAG guidelines and best practices
- **Scalability**: Components can be composed to create complex interfaces

## Theme & Design Tokens

The design system supports both light and dark themes through CSS variables, which can be found in `src/styles/globals.css`. These include:

- **Colors**: Primary, secondary, accent, muted, destructive, success, etc.
- **Typography**: Font families, sizes, weights, line heights
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing scale
- **Border radius**: Consistent rounding
- **Shadows**: Various levels of elevation

## Component Structure

Components are organized into the following categories:

- **UI**: Basic building blocks (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
- **Layout**: Container, Grid, Flex
- **Theme**: Theme-related components (ThemeSwitcher)

## How to Use

Import components directly from their respective locations:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Container } from "@/components/layout/container";
import { ThemeSwitcher } from "@/components/theme/theme-switcher";
```

## Creating Custom Components

When creating custom components, follow these guidelines:

1. Use TypeScript for type safety
2. Implement proper accessibility attributes
3. Use the `cn` utility for class name management
4. Support dark mode through CSS variables
5. Allow for component composition through props

See the example in `src/components/custom/data-card.tsx` for reference.

## Best Practices

- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Document props and component usage
- Test for accessibility compliance
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use composition over inheritance
